CONCEPT
=======

There are five cloud sizes, and five corresponding zoom levels.

Clouds and Fujin on the same level collide.

Fujin will die if he runs out of energy, or if time reaches zero and he hasn't
cleared everything!

Game starts with one brown cloud of maximum size.

Only the clouds of maximum size fart out clouds (of minimum size).

The fart rate increases as the timer counts down.

Clouds slowly grow.

You can move a cloud between size levels by sucking it in, changing zoom and
blowing out again.

When clouds collide they join / destroy as appropriate.

If all the clouds are gone, new clouds appear. They are normal grey clouds. You
can't earn any more points, you just need to wait for the clock to wind down.
