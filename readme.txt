ABOUT
=====

This game is our entry to the 2009 Global Game Jam (http://globalgamejam.org/).
We started with the "Kranzky Engine"; a simple C++ framework that integrates
Haaf's Game Engine (http://hge.relishgames.com/), Box2D (http://www.box2d.org/)
and SQLite (http://www.sqlite.org/), and which supports XBOX360 controllers and
an online leaderboard. Lloyd Kranzky built this engine while participating in
various local gamejam events in Perth, Western Australia (http://gamejam.org/).
We thank him very much for letting us use it.

Apart from the Kranzky Engine, we used Ruby, Cygwin, Git, Vim and Visual C++
2008 Express Edition. Everything was written in C++, apart from our build
script. No Python or Unity here, folks.

CONTROLS
========

CRITERIA
========

1. A complete play session must always last 5 minutes or less.

Yes, a timer counts down from 300secs.

2. As long as we have each other, we will never run out of problems.

If all clouds are destroyed, Fujin goes to sleep, as there's nothing left to do.

Also, the brown clouds are an obvious metaphor for pollution; a big problem.

3. Adjectives: Cloud, Sleepless, Destined

Cloud: Yes, it's all about clouds.

Sleepless: Kind of. Fujin sleeps when he's solved the pollution problem.

Destined: Not really.

THANKS

NOTES
=====

For XBOX controller support, plug in a wired controller and get going. If things
don't work, you may need to download an updated driver:
